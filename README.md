# poppea

A couple of macros that do useful, general things.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JulianBirch/poppea.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JulianBirch/poppea)

## Usage

[![Leiningen version](http://clojars.org/net.colourcoding/poppea/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/net.colourcoding/poppea)

Namespace:

```clj
(:require
  [poppea :refer :all])
```

## document-partial

`document-partial` does the same thing as `partial`, except that
rather than returning a function, it returns a record that does
the same thing and (importantly) is serializable.

```clj
(defn f [a b c d] (+ a b c d))

(document-partial f 1 2)
=> #poppea.DocumentedPartial{:poppea/function #'user/f, :b 2, :a 1}

((document-partial f 1 2) 3 4)
=> 10
```

It's a proper data structure, so you can do things like this:

```clj
((assoc (document-partial f 1 2) :a 5) 3 4)
=> 14
```

Note that this provides a fairly elegant way of serializing
anonymous functions: rewrite to a var function and then use
document-partial.

`document-partial` is a macro, so can't be used in all of the places partial can be.
* The function has to be a symbol referring to a var.  This is nearly always how `partial` is used anyway.
* It's not recursive, so `(document-partial comp identity)` won't perform `document-partial` on identity.  Which is actually a good thing in practice.
* Nesting `document-partial` within an anonymous function works, but is confusing.  I don't recommend doing it, especially considering that it should be considered an alternative to anonymous functions.

### document-partial-%

If you need to insert arguments into the middle of functions, you can call document-partial-%.

```clj
((document-partial-% / % 2) 6)
;;; 6

((document-partial-% list %2 :x) 1 2 3 4)
;;; (2 :x 3 4)
```

Note that you can't put % inside a subexpression or document-partial-% inside a lambda function and expect nice things to happen.

### Easter eggs

`defrecord-get` is the same as `defrecord` but implements acts as
a function the same way a `hash-map` does.  `defrecord-fn` is a
helper function for records that implement `IFn`.

## Currying

Poppea implements very basic ML-style currying in three closely related macros.  defn-curried, defn-curried- and fn-curried

```clj
(defn-curried wrap-handler [handler request]
  (assoc (handler request) :x 3))
```

is the same as

```clj
(defn wrap-handler
  ([handler request]
   (assoc (handler request) :x 3))
  ([handler]
   (fn [request] (assoc (handler request) :x 3))))
```

It should be pointed out that there are a couple of practical issues of which one should be aware when using defn-curried.

 * Since it's not returning a var, reloading on the repl won't change a curried function.
 * Be careful using currying with -> and ->>.  The argument order may not be what you expect.  Clojure doesn't have ML's rich operators.

This is a valid alternative to over-long anonymous functions, and
in my opinion vastly preferable to functions that just return
other functions.

### Performance

`defn-curried` is marginally faster than `partial`.  `document-partial` is significantly slower.  It's very rare that this is material in either direction.

### Road Map

I'd like to implement a version that does eager evaluation of the code that only depends on the curried arguments, but it's much more complex than what has currently been implemented.

It'd also be nice to have a generator macro, which rewrites imperative style code as a reducer.  Turning a reducer into a lazy sequence shoudn't be problematic.

## quick-map

The other macro is coffee-map, which is inspired by Coffeescript's quick map syntax.

```clj
(let [x 3
      y 5]
  (coffee-map x y "a" 78))
```

is the same as

```clj
(hash-map :x 3 :y 5 "a" 78)
```

Basically, this is structuring, the complement of Clojures {:keys [x y]} destructuring.
